# My First Python Project

This is a simple Python script I created to practice basic concepts like user input, conditionals, and random number generation.

## Features:
- Asks for the user's name and age
- Tells you how old you will be in 10 years
- A fun little number guessing game!

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x

## How to Run:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script with Python:

```bash
python main.py
